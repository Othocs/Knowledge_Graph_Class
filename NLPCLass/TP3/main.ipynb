    "### 1. What is a `pipeline` in Hugging Face Transformers? What does it abstract away from the user?\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline is a high-level inference API that makes it easy to use pretrained models. It handles all the complexity behind the scenes: tokenizing the input, running the model, and converting outputs to readable results. You just specify the task and provide data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. List at least 3 other tasks (besides text-classification) available in pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `text-generation` for generating text from a prompt\n",
    "- `automatic-speech-recognition` for transcribing audio\n",
    "- `image-classification` for classifying images\n",
    "- `question-answering` for extracting answers from context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What happens when you don't specify a model? How can you specify a specific model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a model, the pipeline uses a default pretrained model for that task. For `text-classification`, it defaults to `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`.\n",

    "### 1. What does the `aggregation_strategy=\"simple\"` parameter do?\n",
    "\n",
    "It groups tokens with the same entity type together based on BIO tags. Without it, you get individual token predictions. With \"simple\", tokens like B-PER, I-PER, I-PER get merged into a single entity, and subword tokens are combined into complete words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What do the entity types mean? (ORG, MISC, LOC, PER)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Why do some words appear with `##` prefix (like `##tron` and `##icons`)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `##` prefix indicates subword tokens. When a word isn't in the tokenizer's vocabulary, it gets split into smaller pieces. For example, \"Megatron\" becomes \"Mega\" + \"##tron\". The `##` means it's a continuation of the previous token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Why are \"Megatron\" and \"Decepticons\" split incorrectly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained on Reuters news data from 1996-1997 (CoNLL-2003 dataset).

    "## Question 7: Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the default model for text-generation? What architecture does GPT-2 use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The default model is `openai-community/gpt2`. GPT-2 uses a decoder-only transformer architecture with 124M parameters in the base version. It performs autoregressive generation, meaning it predicts the next token based on all previous tokens. Larger variants include gpt2-medium (355M), gpt2-large (774M), and gpt2-xl (1.5B).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why do we use `set_seed(42)` before generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting a random seed ensures reproducibility. When using sampling-based generation (`do_sample=True`), the model randomly selects tokens from a probability distribution. Without a fixed seed, you get different outputs each run. With `set_seed(42)`, the same prompt produces the same output every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What parameters control text generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `temperature`: controls randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.7) make output more focused/deterministic, higher values (e.g., 1.5) make it more random/creative\n",
    "- `top_k`: only samples from the k most likely tokens at each step\n",
    "- `do_sample`: when False, uses greedy decoding (always picks most likely token). When True, enables sampling\n",
    "- `top_p` (nucleus sampling): samples from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p\n",
    "- `max_new_tokens`: limits how many tokens to generate\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What does the truncation warning mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 has a maximum context length of 1024 tokens. If your input prompt exceeds this, the model truncates it to fit. This means early parts of long prompts get cut off, losing context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What does `pad_token_id` being set to `eos_token_id` mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 wasn't trained with a padding token, so it doesn't have one defined. The pipeline automatically uses the end-of-sequence token (ID 50256) as padding. This is needed for batch processing where sequences have different lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What are the trade-offs between model size and generation quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger models like gpt2-xl (1.5B parameters) produce more coherent and contextual text, but are slower and require more memory. Smaller models like gpt2 (124M parameters) are faster and lighter but produce lower quality output. You can balance this with techniques like distillation or quantization."
